## Reasons for using Mouseable, in Replacement of an Actual Computer Mouse 

1. **Better Productivity**

   Ask yourself, do you use your mouse frequently (or at all) during programming? Is it really necessary? I think not. Since, you could very well perform most of the tasks in    your workflow using various keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys, and achieve even better productivity and efficiency, as you would otherwise, achieve using a mouse. Every single action in your IDE of chocie will most likely have a binded shortcut. If you could familiarize yourself with just using a keyboard, instead of relying on a mouse, you will most likely attain way better productivity. For instance, in these common situations listed down below, you don't even need a mouse:
    * In IDE, use vim plugin and shortcuts.
    * In Browser,
      use [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en)
    * Other situations, use mouseable!


2. **Health Benefits**

   Using a mouse puts unnecessary strain on your wrist. As such, just place your wrists in front of your keyboard and maintain that position, instead of constantly having to move your wrist around while using a mouse!

3. **Better Utilization of Existing Table Space**

   Extra table space is required to use a computer mouse. Hence, keep your desk nice and free by putting away your mouse!
   
## Limitations

* Windows Only
* Mouseable must be run with administrator privileges, otherwise it will not work on system software such as Task Manager.
